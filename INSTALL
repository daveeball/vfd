From your RaspberryPi

1) Install dependencies

	sudo apt-get install git-core automake build-essential libtool doxygen
	
	wget http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/bcm2835-1.50.tar.gz
	tar zxvf bcm2835-1.50.tar.gz
	cd bcm2835-1.50/
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install (not neccesary as we're)
	
	git clone  git://git.musicpd.org/master/libmpdclient.git
	cd libmpdclient
	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	sudo make install

2) compile & deploy.

===============================================================
Setting up a dev environment for remote debugging from eclipse
(These are my notes, and aren't expected to be useful to anyone else - don't ask me for help)

copy the following from /usr/local/lib/ to your desktop development environment (saves cross compiling)
	libmpdclient.so.2.0.11
	libbcm2835.a
	
	
	

	
Setup to autorun using daemon tools:
	http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/28199/raspberry-pi-starting-programs-automatically-on-startup

	NOTE: I found that the first time my app is run like this after the pi has booted, it failes to connect to the VFD.
	I added a crontab [@reboot sleep 5; killall vfd;] after which daemontools restarts vfd and all is good.
